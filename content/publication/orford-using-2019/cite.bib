 abstract = {Maturing national data collection initiatives have created new possibilities for chemical risk analysis. This study demonstrates the potential for public datasets in this field, combining a population-level live birth dataset (~29 million records) and national pesticide use volume estimates (~3000 counties) over seven years (2006-2012) to examine whether mothers living in areas with high atrazine use experience higher than average birth defect rates.},
