abstract: "This article looks at expected policy changes that will redefine how oil and gas drilling practices are regulated under federal environmental laws, as well as the impact of increased oil and gas production in driving new infrastructure and facilities proposals needed to deliver these energy resources to market. Finally, the article discusses the tension between two stated policies of the Obama administration: fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing oil and gas production to promote economic growth and energy independence."
