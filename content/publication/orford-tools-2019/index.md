abstract: "This article develops three resources for governments seeking to adapt their regulatory planning processes to withstand new and uncertain climate risks. : 1) a new standard for assessing the quality of climate adaptation decisionmaking, 2) a historical assessment of California's climate adaptation policy development efforts between 1988 and 2018 - from the state's early efforts to study the problem, and 3) four case studies from California's electric power regulatory sector - electric grid reliability planning processes, wildfire risk mapping, coastal generator siting, and rate case risk costing - to demonstrate the difficulties inherent in incorporating climate-relevant data into complex technical proceedings in a transparent and consistent fashion."
