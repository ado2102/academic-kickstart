# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a Ph.D. candidate at U.C. Berkeley's Energy & Resources Group (ERG). My research interests include national and international environmental governance and politics, public policy analysis and development, public administration and management, and ethical philosophy. I am currently focused on understanding the development of anti-environmentalist countermovements. In addition to my studies, I work in various graduate-level capacities, including in teaching roles and research positions. I am also active in graduate student government. I received my MPP from Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) in 2018, concurrent with an MA from the Energy & Resources Group. As an attorney prior to returning to academia, I rep­re­sented pub­lic and pri­vate clients in com­plex envi­ron­men­tal civil lit­i­ga­tion and reg­u­la­tory mat­ters; con­ducted both trial and appel­late lit­i­ga­tion in fed­eral and state courts across the coun­try; and assisted with the envi­ron­men­tal review and com­pli­ance aspects of numer­ous cor­po­rate trans­ac­tions. I received my B.A. from Ari­zona State Uni­versity, and my J.D. from Colum­bia Uni­ver­sity School of Law, where I was the Editor-in-Chief of the Colum­bia Jour­nal of Envi­ron­men­tal Law.
