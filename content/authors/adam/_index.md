Dr. Adam D. Orford joined the University of Georgia School of Law in the fall of 2021. His interdisciplinary research investigates legal and policy approaches to environmental protection, human health and wellbeing, and deep decarbonization of the United States economy. He also participates in grant-funded interdisciplinary research initiatives across UGA, including as the lead of the Georgia element of the National Zoning Atlas, and as a participant in ongoing investigations into the legal, political, environmental, and social dimensions of new energy manufacturing and emerging carbon removal technologies. His recent scholarship has appeared in the *Columbia Journal of Environmental Law*, the *Georgetown Environmental Law Review*, the *Hastings Environmental Law Journal*, and the *Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences*. As an educator and mentor, Professor Orford passionately supports law student success and career development. 

Professor Orford earned his Ph.D. from U.C. Berkeley's Energy & Resources Group. He received his Masters of Public Policy from U.C. Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy, where his work focused on energy policy and regulation. Prior to returning to academia, he was an environmental litigator in private practice for eight years, representing public and private clients in complex environmental civil litigation and regulatory matters. In law school, he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the *Columbia Journal of Environmental Law*.
